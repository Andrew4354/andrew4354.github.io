<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
<p><img src="images/Picture1.png" style= "float:right; padding-left:20px;">
I am hoping that I might get to understand more about networking and cyber security. Information security is such a fascinating topic
and almost sounds like something out of an old hacker movie. Right now, I am looking at a
<b><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51036426?type=standout#searchRequestToken=d1c455a7-ede1-4d59-8e75-ba62eea8fef3">Cyber Security Analyst</a></b>
position as my end goal. <br>
A cyber security analyst monitors networks and responds to security breaches or attacks, sets up protection against attacks,
creates documentation and training material regarding best practices to prevent security breaches, and works closely with company management
to maintain as high a level of security as possible while maintaining an easy-to-use workplace. <br>
Some of the skills or qualifications necessary for this position include:
<ul><li>A qualification in IT (such as an undergraduate or masters in IT)</li>
<li>Further qualifications relating to cyber security such as a certificate in cyber security, or third party vendor certifications.</li>
<li>Experience working in an IT security environment.</li> </ul>

Currently, I have none of the relevant skills or experience needed for this career.<br>
However, I am currently working toward my Bachelor of IT and will be studying a Certificate IV in Cyber Security in early 2021 alongside my Bachelor. Hopefully once I have these qualifications
I may be able to gain an entry level position inside a Cyber Security firm where I can begin working towards gaining the relevant industry experience.
