  <p>My project idea is to develop a mobile app that helps parents to manage chores and good habits for their children. I am looking to develop a mobile game that can be beaten by completing chores and maintaining habits to hopefully make them a more rewarding experience for the kids, but with a intuitive user interface that also helps the parents manage tasks, assign duties to individual kids and plan out the day/week. This game will allow parents to not only manage chores such as doing the dishes or setting the tables, but also reward healthy habits like brushing your teeth.

In recent years with the innovation of technology and the surge in popularity in the video game market it has been increasingly difficult to manage chores and good habits. Kids are spending more time using technology and, while this is not something that is easily changed, it can be used to make doing chores or maintaining healthy habits more interactive and stimulating for the up-and-coming tech-driven minds.

This app will feature an intuitive user interface with a highly customisable schedule designed to make managing chores and habits as easy as possible for a busy parent. The user can assign individual tasks throughout the week (or the day), and this will be easy to see on the home screen that plots tasks on a timeline-style chart. The user will be able to choose whether adventures are completed daily, weekly(recommended), fortnightly or monthly.
The experience will be fully customisable, and the user can tone down the intensity of the gameplay as much as desired or turn off combat entirely. For the more creative parent, the user will also be able to design the adventure the kids will eventually embark on by choosing the scene theme, enemy models, as well as the length and how many chores should be done in order to complete the adventure. The app will also give suggested lengths to help make the experience as enjoyable as possible as well as offer a list of pre-set adventures if preferred.
The user will also be able to customise their teams and their characters, this feature is best used by the kids as they can create the character that appeals to them the most, making the experience much more personal and meaningful.
The user will have multiple reward systems to choose from. These include:
•	A point system. Points are redeemed at the end of the chosen period for gear, special abilities and items. Points are allocated to tasks and the user can specify points attained per task, as well as cost prices for items, (or simply use the recommended settings.) This makes the experience a little more interactive for the kids, however it is a bit more complex and may not be suitable for all users.
•	A simple buff system. Tasks reduce the Health of enemies and increase the health of the player(s). The user can set a percent-based reduction/increase for individual tasks, (or simply use the recommended settings.) A simple system with the drawback of being less interactive.
•	A team-based system. Tasks completed will “rescue” an additional teammate who will fight with the player(s) and provide them with useful buffs, items, or abilities. The user can customise the teammates to make them more personalised, including their name, look, items they carry as well as what task they are assigned to. The user can also use the recommended settings for this. A somewhat middle ground between the two above options, this has the benefit of being relatively simple but can be interactive.
The user also has the option of combining these reward systems and can assign them individually to each task. For example, doing the dishes could reward the player(s) with a new teammate, but brushing your teeth simply awards points to spend at the shop. The whole experience is customisable if the user wishes to do so.
During the adventure, the player(s) will experience a combination of 2d top-down RPG exploration gameplay, NPC (non-player character) dialogue interaction and turn-based action combat (fully customisable and can be turned off, toned down or tuned up as the user desires.) The time and length of each adventure can be customised and can be paused and resumed at any time.

The tools required to complete this project are:
•	A computer with a keyboard and mouse.
•	A dedicated mobile app development tool or a coding IDE that has the functionality to output to an emulated mobile/tablet environment.
•	An image creation tool that can create assets to be imported into the app.

The skills required to complete this project are:
•	Experience or practice with a coding language that can develop mobile apps.
•	Experience or practice with creating sprites and other assets for mobile apps.
I believe it to be feasible to find individuals with experience in these skills, or to practice these skills. A computer with a keyboard and mouse is readily accessible by most individuals these days, and free software is available for app development and image creation with a quick internet search.

If this project is successful, hopefully the app helps individuals that are currently struggling to manage their children’s chores or duties around the house do so. This app may have an impact on kids who are finding it difficult to be motivated to do chores around the house or keep healthy habits. This app is designed to not only make chores rewarding and fun, but also as an intuitive user interface for managing and assigning duties.
