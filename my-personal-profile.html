<h2>My Personal Profile</h2>

<h3 style="text-align:center">The Meyers Briggs Test</h3>
<img src="images/MeyersB.png" alt="" style="float:center;">
<img src="images/Personality.png" alt="" style="float:center;width:92%">
<p>The results of my Myers Briggs test indicate that I am a Turbulent Logician type, my role is Analyst, and my Strategy is Constant Improvement. <br>
I am 97% introverted, with very close Prospecting and Turbulent scores at 65% and 64% respectively.</p>
<p>This result did not come as a surprise to me. I expected to be high introversion, and it is something that I could easily tell you about myself. I am very shy and this often makes working in groups a lot harder.<br>
However, I am a good team player and am always working to improve myself and gain further knowledge. I am usually very good at what I do, I just need a bit of a push to speak up about it.</p><br>

<h3 style="text-align:center">The Learning Styles Test</h3>
<img src="images/Learning-Style.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>My results from the learning styles test indicate that I am mostly a reflector style and pragmatist style. I scored very low on the activist and theorist styles.<br>
This result is the only one I slightly disagree on. The results of this test would indicate that I learn by observation, collecting and analysing data from others and my own past experiences. The test would also
indicate I am pragmatic in my learning, meaning I need to be able to apply abstract concepts to real-world problems to understand them fully. I disagree with this assessment and find that I learn best by doing, failing, and
then working out what went wrong. Somewhat of a cross between activist and reflector. I have no issues as far as I know applying abstract concepts to my learnings.</p> <br>

<h3 style="text-align:center">The Big 5 Personality Test</h3>
<img src="images/Big5.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The big 5 personality test shows that I score highly in imagination and intellect and value these the highest. <br>
I feel that this solidifies my results from the Myers-Briggs test that showed that I am logical but also abstract in my thinking. I also scored highly on agreeableness,
which will make me a good team player, able to take in otherâ€™s viewpoints and contribute to group discussions.</p> <br>

<h3 style="text-align:center">Summary</h3>
<p>The results of the three tests did not come as a surprise for me. I am very aware of myself and the strengths and weaknesses I may have in my personality and my style of learning.<br></br>
In terms of the Myers-Briggs test, my results show that I am very logical in my thinking and can analyse and interpret the world more easily than others. I am also a great abstract thinker and can recognize and understand
abstract concepts more easily than others, which also enables me to be more imaginative and creative than others when dealing with complex problems. I also tend to be more open minded and objective in conversations with others.<br><br>
Regarding the learning style test, I mostly a reflector, meaning I learn best by observation. I collect and analyse information from both prior experiences and my current experience to learn best. I am also quite pragmatic in my
learning which means I need to be able to apply abstract concepts to the real world. I disagree with this assessment and find that I enjoy learning by doing and can handle applying abstract concepts to everyday life.<br><br>
The results showed that in a team, I can contribute valuable information as I think abstractly and can solve complex problems and apply straight-forward solutions. However, my introverted nature may hinder me from speaking up, and
I may rely on a more extroverted individual to ask for my input. As I learn by reflecting on experience, I may need to try different things before I can come up with an appropriate solution to a problem. This may clash with
individuals who may be more theory driven and lead to disagreements.<br><br>
I should think carefully when forming a team to try and find individuals who are also more experience-driven learners, but be careful to find those who may be a little more extroverted and natural leaders, so that I might be prompted
to give my input more often. One of my weaknesses as a Logician is that I am private and withdrawn, and may require someone to prompt me to involve myself in a team discussion.
