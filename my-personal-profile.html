  <p>The results of the three tests did not come as a surprise for me. I am very aware of myself and the strengths and weaknesses I may have in my personality and my style of learning.
In terms of the Myers-Briggs test, my results show that I am very logical in my thinking and can analyse and interpret the world in a more straight-forward way. I am also a great abstract thinker and can recognize and understand abstract concepts more easily than others, which also enables me to be more imaginative and creative than others when dealing with complex problems. I also tend to be more open minded and objective in conversations with others. Regarding the learning style test, I mostly a reflector, meaning I learn best by observation. I collect and analyse information from both prior experiences and my current experience to learn best. I am also quite pragmatic in my learning which means I need to be able to apply abstract concepts to the real world. I slightly disagree with this assessment and find that I enjoy learning by doing and can handle applying abstract concepts to everyday life. The big 5 personality test shows that I score highly in imagination and intellect and value these the highest. I feel that this solidifies my results from the Myers-Briggs test that showed that I am logical but also abstract in my thinking. I also scored highly on agreeableness, which will make me a good team player, able to take in otherâ€™s viewpoints and contribute to group discussions.
The results showed that in a team, I can contribute valuable information as I think abstractly and can solve complex problems and apply straight-forward solutions. However, my introverted nature may hinder me from speaking up, and I may rely on a more extroverted individual to ask for my input. As I learn by reflecting on experience, I may need to try different things before I can come up with an appropriate solution to a problem. This may clash with individuals who may be more theory driven and lead to disagreements.
I should think carefully when forming a team to try and find individuals who are also more experience-driven learners, but be careful to find those who may be a little more extroverted and natural leaders, so that I might be prompted to give my input more often. One of my weaknesses as a Logician is that I am private and withdrawn, and may require someone to prompt me to involve myself in a team discussion.
