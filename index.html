<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Andrew. I am a 24-year-old IT enthusiast looking to get into the IT sector and begin a career in tech.
I have not had much of a professional career as of yet, I have experience in customer service and retail, hospitality and manufacturing,
but never felt like I was building a career. For me, IT is a career and something I aspire to build upon.
In my spare time I am usually playing video games (somewhat obvious), watching Netflix or YouTube, cooking/baking, or taking a walk.
I have a rather simple life, born in Australia, currently living with my partner and our four pet birds.

<h3>My Interest in IT </h3>
<p>I am looking for a first step into the world of IT as I have not yet had any professional experience in the industry, however,
I have grown up surrounded by computers and technology and been fascinated by the idea of tech since I was a little kid.
I first sat down and used a computer at age 3, as my dad showed me how to move a mouse and type on a keyboard.
At age 6 I owned my own PC and used it to play educational games, draw on MS Paint, and mess about with the voice recorder on Windows XP.
At age 10 my dad gave me a big box of PC parts and told me to build myself a new PC, this really was a turning point in my love for technology.
It was one thing to have my own PC but to have one that I put together myself was something else.
I chose to pursue the bachelor of IT at RMIT as I was looking for a way of attaining a high-end qualification online.
I prefer online study to in-class studies personally, as it means I can study as much content as I would like to and go at my own pace.
It also means I am not locked into study and life can shift and move around without affecting my ability to learn. RMIT is also a well-respected
institution and is widely known. A qualification through RMIT will certainly carry some weight in the industry.
I expect that the Introduction to IT course will teach me the fundamentals of working in the IT industry. Within the first 3 weeks
I have already learned so much, I understand the purpose of GitHub and I am enjoying learning HTML. I hope to continue learning about all the nuances
within the IT industry.
