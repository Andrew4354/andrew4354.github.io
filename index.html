<h1> </h1>
<p>My name is Andrew. I am a 24-year-old IT enthusiast looking to get into the IT sector and begin a career in tech.
I have not had much of a professional career as of yet, I have experience in customer service and retail, hospitality and manufacturing, 
but never felt like I was building a career. For me, IT is a career and something I aspire to build upon.
In my spare time I am usually playing video games (somewhat obvious), watching Netflix or YouTube, cooking/baking, or taking a walk.
I have a rather simple life, born in Australia, currently living with my partner and our four pet birds.
